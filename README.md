# [Avatar Creator](https://mzk468.github.io/Avatar-Creator/)

Avatar Creator, made with Vue.js for the HackBytes II hackathon!

## So... what is it?

Ever created an account somewhere and weren't able to find any good pictures anywhere? I've got you covered! With the **Avatar Creator** you can quickly generate an avatar for yourself by creating a fun little image of a person that represents you as closely as possible!

This project is a front-end only website, which you can visit [here](https://mzk468.github.io/Avatar-Creator/)! This means that **no downloads are required** - simply visit the website and get customising!
